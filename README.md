AIDA Report Summary
===================
This Java utility is used to Summarize reports generated by AIDA64 Business

Description
-----------
* Reads multiple CSV reports, each source report belongs to a single workstation
* Filters the reports for duplicates and errors falslely reported by AIDA 
* Summarizes data into 4 report files: Computers, Displays, Licences, Outdated
* Each line in the summary report represents a single Computer, Display etc. with its atributes

Notes, Problems
---------------
* The peak memory usage on Windows (7,8,10) can be 400-800MB when summarizing ~200+ source files, this should be fixed (String -> Stringbuilder?)
* The code was once refactored with the comp-dupe-filter, but it is still far from clean code
* Classes have too many responsibilities (should decompose to more classes)
* Some functions have too many paramteres, do too many things, and code inside them is not always on the same level of abstraction
