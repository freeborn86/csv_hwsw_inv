AIDA Report Summary
===================
This Java utility is used to Summarize reports generated by AIDA64 Business

Description
-----------
* Reads multiple CSV reports, each source report belongs to a single workstation
* Filters the reports for duplicates and errors falslely reported by AIDA 
* Summarizes data into 4 report files: Computers, Displays, Licences, Outdated
* Each line in the summary report represents a single Computer, Display etc. with its atributes

Notes
-----
* The peak memory usage on Windows (7,8,10) can be 400-800Mb when conv Summarizing ~200+ source files, this should be fixed (String -> Stringbuilder?)
* The code was once refactored when the comp-dupe-filter branch was created, yet there remain quite a few places to refactor and clean up
